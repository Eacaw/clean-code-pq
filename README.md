# Clean Code Quiz Platform

## About the Clean Code Quiz

The Clean Code Quiz is an interactive, team-based quiz platform designed to test and improve your programming knowledge and code quality skills. Sessions are hosted live, with teams joining to answer a series of questions in real time. The platform supports a variety of question types, automatic and manual marking, and a live leaderboard.

### How the Quiz Works

- **Sessions**: An admin creates and hosts a quiz session. Players join a session using a session code.
- **Teams**: Players form teams and submit answers as a group.
- **Questions**: Each session consists of a series of questions, presented one at a time. Each question has a time limit.
- **Marking**: Some questions are marked automatically (e.g., multiple choice), while others require manual review by an admin (e.g., code explanations).
- **Leaderboard**: Scores are updated live, and a leaderboard is shown at the end.

## Marking and Scoring

- **Automatic Marking**: MCQ and QA questions are marked automatically. QA uses flexible regex matching to accept minor variations in answers.
- **Manual Marking**: Edit Code, Concise Code, and Explain This Code questions are marked by admins using a star rating system or a single checkbox (for QA manual verification).
- **Bonus Points**: Concise Code questions can award bonus points for the shortest correct submissions.
- **Leaderboard**: Team scores are calculated and displayed on a live leaderboard at the end of the session.
